This globe visualization relies on this repo from the Google Data Arts Team: https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe/

This version was coded during the April 2015 DataDive with Earth Hour Global. The only changes to the original repo were:
* removing directories and files that were not used
* changed the data in the json file
* changed index.html
* changed the jpg for the map on the globe
